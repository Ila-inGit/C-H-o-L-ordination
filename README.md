This is the Master Thesis project:

The application, later renamed as Jupiter, is a Mixed Reality application that runs on HoloLens2 headset.  
The Jupiter application is a new tool designed to identify language impairments by assessing anticipatory skills.  
It uses Augmented Reality and HoloLens 2 technology to provide an immersive experience for subjects and improve the accuracy of data collection.  
The application allows therapists to customize activities to meet the specific needs of individual subjects, potentially promoting lifelong learning and well-being.

The system architecture includes the HoloLens application, the NuxtJS Web App interface (Jupiter Metaplatform project), and the Node.js back-end server (Jupiter Server project).
